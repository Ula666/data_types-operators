# Let's see the data types in action
#
# a = 24 #int
# b = 16 #int
# c = 5.5 #float

# print(a + b)
# print(a - b)
# print(a * b)
# print(a / b)
# print(a + c)

# Boolean values
# print(a > b)
# print(a < b)

# lets build in methods for boolean
# greetings = "Hello World!"
# isalpha()  help us find if the variable holding letters
# print(greetings.isalpha())

# check if the statement is in lowercase
# print(greetings.islower())
#
# print(greetings.endswith("!"))
# print(greetings.startswith("H"))
# in SQL we have seen Null but in Python we have None
# which is a key word in Python
# x = None
# print(type(x))
# print(x is None)
